title: "Gitlab Runner SSH Clone"
---
Almost a month ago I wrote about [Adding SSH Clone to Gitlab Runner](https://blog.matthiaskay.de/2022/11/18/gitlab-runner-with-ssh-clone/).
Today I saw that version 15.7 of Gitlab Runner was released and contains this feature. It took me 5 months to get
the feature into the official release.

Now it's time to archive my Gitlab Runner fork. There is no need to maintain it and host a patched version of the
Gitlab Runner.

Hooray! <i class="fa-solid fa-rocket"></i>
