title: "Linting Pull Requests"

We use the Pull Request title and description as commit message for the `master` branch as we always squash the
commits from the feature branch for a clean history. I have seen so many bad commit messages (and
sometimes I also use "x" or some automatically generated text) that it is better to squash everything. This way you
can focus on the Pull Request description without thinking too much about a single commit message (it's a documentation
of your ongoing work). But now it is important to have a good description in the Pull Request as it becomes part
of commit history.

Furthermore, we use the commit history to generate the release documentation. But it has to follow a certain format otherwise
we can't process it automatically. That's the reason why we lint the Pull Request.

There are several standards out there. We follow the Angular convention of
[Conventional Commits](https://https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/#summary).

## How to lint a Pull Request

There is a great action available on GitHub: [amannn/action-semantic-pull-request](https://github.com/amannn/action-semantic-pull-request)
It's well documented and easy to use. In case your Pull Request does not follow the specification, the pipeline is
red and you have to do your homework.

```yaml
name: "Lint PR"

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types:
      - opened
      - edited
      - synchronize

jobs:
  main:
    name: Validate PR title
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: amannn/action-semantic-pull-request@v5
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ "{{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN " }}}}
```
