# Why this blog?

During my holidays I read several blogs and listen to some podcasts about DevOps, agility, and cloud topics in general.
Some of them are working others don't, especially in an enterprise environment I am working in. On the other hand, there
are still guys out there which haven't heard about all these things. Let's change that!

This blog mainly deals with the technical DevOps process, CI/CD integrations and toolchains. I will also shed some light
on typical cloud services which are useful for your projects.

Enjoy!
