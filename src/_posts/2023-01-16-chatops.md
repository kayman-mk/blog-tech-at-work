title: "ChatOps, or how to trigger actions"
tags: ChatOps trigger workflow
---
Ever heard about ChatOps? Simply said it's triggering actions via chat, e.g. `/deploy service1 staging`. Depending on the
integrations used, this can be triggered via a messager, ticket system or MS Teams, Slack, ... This message is then processed
by a Bot or even simpler via a workflow for GitHub users (see example below). The action is then executed and triggers a
deployment or formats the source code or calls for help ...

The biggest benefit is, that all users can see the interaction and result created by the Bot. It is documented in the chat,
pull or merge request or ticket system and is usually visible to anybody. You see the date/time the action was triggered
and what was done.

This can also be used to offer functions to the help desk, like restarting a server. This will be documented in the ticket
and the help desk user needs no special role to access the cloud systems, ... as it is done by the Bot.

Other benefits:

- automate tasks like manual deployments
- lowers communication barriers
- transparency

## Example

The following files show a ChatOps system implemented as a GitHub workflow. It supports the `/help` command only which
creates a comment in the PR asking a maintainer to help the current user.

```yml
---
name: PR commented

on:
  issue_comment:
    types:
      - created

jobs:
  slash-command-dispatch:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Slash Command Dispatch
        uses: peter-evans/slash-command-dispatch@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          issue-type: pull-request
          reactions: false
          commands: |
            help
```

Defines the possible commands and dispatches them as `repository_dispatch` event.

```yml
---
name: Execute ChatOps command

on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: 
      - help-command

jobs:
  help-command:
    name: "ChathOps: Help"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Choose maintainer
        id: vars
        run: |
          maintainers=("github-user1" "github-user2")
          
          RANDOM=$(date +%s)
          
          maintainer=${maintainers[ $RANDOM % ${#maintainers[@]} ]}
          echo "maintainer=$maintainer" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      - name: Create comment
        uses: peter-evans/create-or-update-comment@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          repository: ${{ github.event.client_payload.github.payload.repository.full_name }}
          issue-number: ${{ github.event.client_payload.github.payload.issue.number }}
          body: |
            Hey there @${{ steps.vars.outputs.maintainer }}, could you please
            help @${{ github.event.client_payload.github.payload.comment.user.login }} out?
```

Executes the `/help` command by creating the comment in the PR.
